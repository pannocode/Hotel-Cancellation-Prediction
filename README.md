    3. Ada boosting, 
    4. XGBoosting
    5. Gradient Boosting.

**Evaluation Metrics Used**
    
    1. ROC AUC Curve
    2. Classification Reports
        1. Recall
        2. Precision
        3. F1 Score
    3. Accuracy Score


## Motivation and Goal

Hotel and facility business are booming with profit following the trend of tourism but the only thing that haunts its profitability is the last minute cancellation as it renders the hotels with a lost of opportuity of profit realisation as well as wasted cost room preparation management, which is sometimes rented with great discounts. 

Lets Explore the available data.
